## Review
- The problem was solving a fill-in-the-blank problem where some content was replaced by a blank in the code, and how to write the output.
- Fill-in-the-blank problems were marked with a score before the blank. However, this confused me.
- In the case of question 3, I didn't write the quotation marks(`'` and `"` for example.) separately and didn't write align for `point` because I didn't read the question correctly.
- It was difficult to understand the problem, but it was easy to solve once I understood it.
- I won't get the top spot of this class through.
